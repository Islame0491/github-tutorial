## Git vs. GitHub
So you want to learn the ways of git and github. This tutorial will help you do so but before we go into depth on that you need to know what git and github are, how they are used and why they are used together.
Git is a version control system developed by linux. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
Github is a service that hosts git repositories. GitHub is essentially made up of two words Git, which we already know what that is, and hub which is defined by webster as 
the effective center of an activity, region, or network. So if we put it together it is a center in which git is echanged utilized etc, github describes their company as "a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Which lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
So now you know what git and github are, its time to explain the differences. 
Git is taking snapshots of code and it doesn't require Github, on the other hand Github requires Git, it stores the code in the "clouds" known as the website in this case its c9.

* Now we have to connect the two programs together, merge them in a way
* To do this we use whats called an SSH Key
* SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user
